Considering the case of estimating the regresson funciotn E(Yi|Xi=x)=m(x) for a set of IID pairs of random varibale 
(X1, Y1), ..., (Xn, Yn). Nadaraya-Watson regression is used to estimate m(x) by m^_n(x) = 
where K is the kernel functoin and h is the bandwidth.


# [Project Name]
We are going to construct and
plot the Nadaraya-Watson estimator using the bandwidths h=0.5, 2.5, 5, 10. The analysis has been done in R programming languge.
